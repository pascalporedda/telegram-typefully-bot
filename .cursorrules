Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Code Style 
- Write concise, technical Rust code with accurate examples
- Use functional and struct based programming patterns; use traits and generics where appropriate
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

## Database
- Use @SQLX for database operations
- Use sqlite as the database provider; keep those limitations imposed from Sqlite in mind

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and functions

## Documentation
- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Document API interactions and data flows
- Keep manifest.json well-documented
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
- Document permission requirements
